                        Matt Branham is a multidisciplinary artist and educator whose practice bridges the tactile and the digital. Rooted in ceramics and traditional craft methodologies, Matt currently works as a digital fabrication educator, bringing a nuanced understanding of how handwork and computational tools inform one another. His work has been exhibited nationally and internationally, while their teaching philosophy, shaped by an MFA with a focus on pedagogy and arts education, continues to evolve through conference presentations and ongoing research.
Matt's studio practice refuses singular categories: Kirkland Signature mouth grills, furniture, functional pottery, and experimental objects emerge from the same restless creative drive. Whether working in clay, metal, or code, he remain committed to making as a form of inquiry, always onto something.
